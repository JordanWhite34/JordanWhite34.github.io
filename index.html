      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Jordan White, a passionate computer science and machine learning student and enthusiast based in Seattle, Washington. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Washington and have developed a strong interest in the fields of artificial intelligence, data science, and software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into the world of programming started with learning Java during my freshman year. Since then, I have expanded my skill set by learning various programming languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, and C as well as technologies such as TensorFlow, React, PyTorch, Pandas, and NumPy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on several projects, ranging from web applications to machine learning models. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and am constantly seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world scenarios. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on society.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy hiking, playing the guitar, or finding a new coffee shop to go to. I believe that a well-balanced lifestyle helps me stay focused and motivated, allowing me to be more effective in my work.
      </p>
